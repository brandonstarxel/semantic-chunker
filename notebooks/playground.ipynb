And he said, “I address you at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union”. Hitler was on the march. War was raging in Europe.\\n\\nPresident Roosevelt’s purpose was to wake up Congress and alert the American people that this was no ordinary time. Freedom and democracy were under assault in the world.\\n\\nTonight, I come to the same chamber to address the nation. Now it’s we who face an unprecedented moment in the history of the Union.\\n\\nAnd, yes, my purpose tonight is to wake up the Congress and alert the American people that this is no ordinary moment either. Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault at home as they are today.\\n\\nWhat makes our moment rare is that freedom and democracy are under attack at — both at home and overseas at the very same time.\\n\\nOverseas, Putin of Russia is on the march, invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond.\\n\\nIf anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you: He will not.\\n\\nBut Ukraine — Ukraine can stop Putin. Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that it needs to defend itself.\\n\\nThat is all — that is all Ukraine is asking. They’re not asking for American soldiers. In fact, there are no American soldiers at war in Ukraine, and I’m determined to keep it that way.\\n\\nBut now assistance to Ukraine is being blocked by those who want to walk away from our world leadership.\\n\\nIt wasn’t long ago when a Republican president named Ronald Reagan thundered, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.”\\n\\nNow — now my predecessor, a former Republican president, tells Putin, quote, “Do whatever the hell you want.”\\n\\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: That’s a quote.\\n\\nA former president actually said that — bowing down to a Russian leader. I think it’s outrageous, it’s dangerous, and it’s unacceptable.\\n\\nAmerica is a founding member of NATO, the military alliance of democratic nations created after World War Two prevent — to prevent war and keep the peace.\\n\\nAnd today, we’ve made NATO stronger than ever. We welcomed Finland to the Alliance last year. And just this morning, Sweden officially joined, and their minister is here tonight. Stand up. Welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome. And they know how to fight', 67, 2493)\n",

The free world will be at risk, emboldening others to do what they wish to do us harm.\\n\\nMy message to President Putin, who I’ve known for a long time, is simple: We will not walk away. We will not bow down. I will not bow down.\\n\\nIn a literal sense, history is watching. History is watching — just like history watched three years ago on January 6th when insurrectionists stormed this very Capitol and placed a dagger to the throat of American democracy.\\n\\nMany of you were here on that darkest of days. We all saw with our own eyes the insurrectionists were not patriots. They had come to stop the peaceful transfer of power, to overturn the will of the people.\\n\\nJanuary 6th lies about the 2020 election and the plots to steal the election posed a great — gravest threat to U.S. democracy since the Civil War.\\n\\nBut they failed. America stood — America stood strong and democracy prevailed. We must be honest: The threat to democracy must be defended (defeated).\\n\\nMy predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6th. I will not do that.\\n\\nThis is a moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies. Here’s the simple truth: You can’t love your country only when you win.\\n\\nAs I’ve done ever since being elected to office, I ask all of you, without regard to party, to join together and defend democracy. Remember your oath of office to defend against all threats foreign and domestic.\\n\\nRespect — respect free and fair elections, restore trust in our institutions, and make clear political violence has absolutely no place — no place in America. Zero place.\\n\\nAgain, it’s not — it’s not hyperbole to suggest history is watching. They’re watching. Your children and grandchildren will read about this day and what we do.\\n\\nHistory is watching another assault on freedom. Joining us tolight (tonight) is Latorya Beasley, a social worker from Birmingham, Alabama.\\n\\nFourteen months ago — fourteen months ago, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to the miracle of IVF. She scheduled treatments to have that second child, but the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the state, unleashed by a Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade', 2721, 5002)\n",

Unless Congress acts, it could happen again.\\n\\nSo, tonight, let’s stand up for families like hers. To my friends across the aisle — don’t keep this waiting any longer. Guarantee the right to IVF', 5004, 5302)\n",

She’d become pregnant again and had a fetus with a fatal condition. Her doctor told Kate that her own life and her ability to have future in the fil- — children in the future were at risk if she didn’t act. Because Texas law banned her ability to act, Kate and her husband had to leave the state to get what she needed.\\n\\nWhat her family had gone through should have never happened as well. But it’s happening to too many others.\\n\\nThere are state laws banning the freedom to choose, criminalizing doctors, forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states to get the treatment they need.\\n\\nMany of you in this chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom.\\n\\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: My God, what freedom else would you take away?\\n\\nLook, its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote the following — and with all due respect, Justices — “Women are not without electoral — electoral power” — excuse me — “electoral or political power.”\\n\\nYou’re about to realize just how much you were right about that.\\n\\nClearly — clearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women.\\n\\nBut they found out. When reproductive freedom was on the ballot, we won in 2022 and 2023. And we’ll win again in 2024.\\n\\nIf you — if you, the American people, send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again.\\n\\nFolks, America cannot go back.\\n\\nI am here to- — tonight to show what I believe is the way forward, because I know how far we’ve come.\\n\\nFour years ago next week, before I came to office, the country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in a century.\\n\\nRemember the fear, record losses?\\n\\nRemember the spikes in crime and the murder rate? A raging virus that took more than 1 million American lives of loved ones, millions left behind.\\n\\nA mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness.\\n\\nA president, my predecessor, failed in the most basic presidential duty that he owes to American people: the duty to care.\\n\\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Lies!\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I think that’s unforgivable.\\n\\nI came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in the nation’s history. We have.\\n\\nIt doesn’t make new, but in a — news — in a thousand cities and towns, the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told.\\n\\nSo, let’s tell the story here — tell it here and now.\\n\\nAmerica’s comeback is building a future of American possibilities; building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down; investing in all of America, in all Americans to make every- — sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one — no one behind.\\n\\nThe pandemic no longer controls our lives. The vaccine that saved us from COVID is — are now being used to beat cancer.\\n\\nTurning setback into comeback. That’s what America does. That’s what America does.\\n\\nFolks, I inherited an economy that was on the brink. Now, our economy is literally the envy of the world.\\n\\nFifteen million new jobs in just three years. A record. A record.\\n\\nUnemployment at 50-year lows.\\n\\nA record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses, and each one is a literal act of hope, with historic job growth and small-business growth for Black and Hispanics and Asian Americans. Eight hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs in America and counting.\\n\\nWhere is it written we can’t be the manufacturing capital of the world? We are and we will.\\n\\nMore people have health insurance today — more people have health insurance today than ever before.\\n\\nThe racial wealth gap is the smallest it’s been in 20 years.\\n\\nWages keep going up. Inflation keeps coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9 percent to 3 percent — the lowest in the world and tending (trending) lower.\\n\\nThe landing is and will be soft. And now, instead of aporting — importing foreign products and exporting American jobs, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs right here in America, where they belong.\\n\\nAnd it takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring.\\n\\n“Buy America” has been the law of the land since the 1930s. Past administrations, including my predecessor — including some Democrats, as well, in the past — failed to buy American. Not anymore.\\n\\nOn my watch, federal projects that you fund — like helping build American roads, bridges, and highways — will be made with American products and built by American workers creating good-paying American jobs.\\n\\nAnd thanks to our CHIPS and Science Act the United States is investing more in research and development than ever before. During the pandemic, a shortage of semiconductors, chips that drove up the price of everything from cell phones to automobiles — and, by the way, we invented those chips right here in America.\\n\\nWell, instead of having to import them, instead of — private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America creating tens of thousands of jobs, many of those jobs paying $100,000 a year and don’t require a college degree.\\n\\nIn fact, my policies have attracted $650 billion in private-sector investment in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America.\\n\\nAnd thanks — and thanks to our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, 46,000 new projects have been announced all across your communities.\\n\\nAnd, by the way, I noticed some of you who’ve strongly voted against it are there cheering on that money coming in.

It’s transformative.\\n\\nThe great comeback story is Belvidere, Illinois. Home to an auto plant for nearly 60 years. Before I came to office, the plant was on its way to shutting down. Thousands of workers feared for their livelihoods. Hope was fading.\\n\\nThen, I was elected to office, and we raised Belvidere repeatedly with auto companies, knowing unions would make all the difference. The UAW worked like hell to keep the plant open and get these jobs back. And together, we succeeded.\\n\\nInstead of auto factories shutting down, auto factories are reopening and a new state-of-the-art battery factory is being built to power those cars there at the same.\\n\\nTo the folks — to the folks of Belvidere, I’d say: Instead of your town being left behind, your community is moving forward again. Because instead of watching auto ja- — jobs of the future go overseas, 4,000 union jobs with higher wages are building a future in Belvidere right here in America.\\n\\nHere tonight is UAW President Shawn Fain, a great friend and a great labor leader. Shawn, where are you? Stand up.\\n\\nAnd — and Dawn — and Dawn Simms, a third-generation worker — UAW worker at Belvidere.\\n\\nShawn, I was proud to be the first President to stand in the picket line. And today, Dawn has a good job in her hometown, providing stability for her family and pride and dignity as well.\\n\\nShowing once again Wall Street didn’t build America. They’re not bad guys. They didn’t build it, though. The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class.\\n\\nI say to the American people: When America gets knocked down, we get back up. We keep going. That’s America. That’s you, the American people.\\n\\nIt’s because of you America is coming back. It’s because of you our future is brighter. It’s because of you that tonight we can proudly say the state of our Union is strong and getting stronger.\\n\\nAUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Tonight — tonight, I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together — a future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy and the biggest corporations no longer get the — all the tax breaks.\\n\\nAnd, by the way, I understand corporations. I come from a state that has more corporations invested than every one of your states in the state — the United States combined. And I represented it for 36 years. I’m not anti-corporation.\\n\\nBut I grew up in a home where trickle-down economics didn’t put much on my dad’s kitchen table. That’s why I’m determined to turn things around so the middle class does well. When they do well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well', 11373, 14862)\n",

Just pay your fair share in taxes.\\n\\nA fair tax code is how we invest in things that make this country great: healthcare, education, defense, and so much more.\\n\\nBut here’s the deal. The last administration enacted a $2 trillion tax cut overwhelmingly benefit the top 1 percent — the very wealthy —\\n\\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: — and the biggest corporations — and exploded the federal deficit.\\n\\nThey added more to the national debt than any presidential term in American history. Check the numbers.\\n\\nFolks at home, does anybody really think the tax code is fair?\\n\\nAUDIENCE: No!\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Do you really think the wealthy and big corporations need another $2 trillion tax break?\\n\\nAUDIENCE: No!', 20454, 23267)\n",

No child should go hungry in this country.\\n\\nThe way to make the tax code fair is to make big corporations and the very wealthy begin to pay their share.

Zero.\\n\\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Not anymore.\\n\\nThanks to the law I wrote and we signed, big companies now have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. But that’s still less than working people pay in federal taxes.\\n\\nIt’s time to raise the corporate minimum tax to at least 21 percent so every big corporation finally begins to pay their fair share.\\n\\nI also want to end tax breaks for Big Pharma, Big Oil, private jets, massive executive pay when it was only supposed to be a million bal- — a million dollars that could be deducted. They can pay them $20 million if they want, but deduct a million.\\n\\nEnd it now.\\n\\nYou know, there are 1,000 billionaires in America.

Imagine a future with affordable childcare, millions of families can get what they need to go to work to help grow the economy.\\n\\nImagine a future with paid leave, because no one should have to choose between working and taking care of their sick family member.\\n\\nImagine — imagine a future with home care and eldercare, and people living with disabilities so they can stay in their homes and family caregivers can finally get the pay they deserve.\\n\\nTonight, let’s all agree once again to stand up for seniors.\\n\\nMany of my friends on the other side of the aisle want to put Social Security on the chopping block.\\n\\nIf anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age, I will stop you.\\n\\nThe working people — the working people who built this country pay more into Social Security than millionaires and billionaires do. It’s not fair.\\n\\nWe have two ways to go. Republicans can cut Social Security and give more tax breaks to the wealthy. I will —\\n\\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: That’s the proposal. Oh, no? You guys don’t want another $2 trillion tax cut?\\n\\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Liar!\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I kind of thought that’s what your plan was. Well, that’s good to hear. You’re not going to cut another $2 trillion for the super-wealthy? That’s good to hear.\\n\\nI’ll protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share.\\n\\nLook, too many corporations raise prices to pad their profits, charging more and more for less and less.\\n\\nThat’s why we’re cracking down on corporations that engage in price gouging and deceptive pricing, from food to healthcare to housing.\\n\\nIn fact, the snack companies think you won’t notice if they change the size of the bag and put a hell of a lot fewer — same — same size bag -— put fewer chips in it. No, I’m not joking. It’s called “shrink-flation.”\\n\\nPass Bobby Casey’s bill and stop this. I really mean it.\\n\\nYou probably all saw that commercial on Snickers bars. And you get — you get charged the same amount, and you got about, I don’t know, 10 percent fewer Snickers in it.\\n\\nLook, I’m also getting rid of junk fees — those hidden fees — at the end of your bill that are there without your knowledge. My administration announced we’re cutting credit card late fees from $32 to $8.\\n\\nBanks and credit card companies are allowed to charge what it costs them to in- — to instigate the collection. And that’s more — a hell of a lot like $8 than 30-some dollars.\\n\\nBut they don’t like it. The credit card companies don’t like it, but I’m saving American families $20 billion a year with all of the junk fees I’m eliminating.\\n\\nFolks at home, that’s why the banks are so mad. It’s $20 billion in profit', 24682, 27838)\n",

And it’s worth the — taking the chance of the $8,000.\\n\\n(Cross-talk.)\\n\\nBut — but if it’s only six mon- — six weeks, the idea is it’s highly unlikely that people will pay that money and come all that way knowing that they’ll be — able to be kicked out quickly.\\n\\nFolks, I would respectfully su- — suggest to my friend in — my Republican friends owe it to the American people.

More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed —\\n\\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Says who?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: — most of whom are not Hamas. Thousands and thousands of innocents — women and children.

Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.\\n\\nAs we look to the future, the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time.\\n\\nAnd I say this as a lifelong supporter of Israel, my entire career.

Four more years!\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans, the issue facing our nation isn’t how old we are; it’s how old are our ideas.\\n\\nHate, anger, revenge, retribution are the oldest of ideas. But you can’t lead America with ancient ideas that only take us back. To lead America, the land of possibilities, you need a vision for the future and what can and should be done.\\n\\nTonight, you’ve heard mine.\\n\\nI see a future where (we’re) defending democracy, you don’t diminish it.\\n\\nI see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect our freedoms, not take them away.\\n\\nI see a future where the middle class has — finally has a fair shot and the wealthy have to pay their fair share in taxes.\\n\\nI see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.\\n\\nAbove all, I see a future for all Americans. I see a country for all Americans. And I will always be President for all Americans because I believe in America. I believe in you, the American people. You’re the reason we’ve never been more optimistic about our future than I am now.\\n\\nSo, let’s build the future together. Let’s remember who we are.\\n\\nWe are the United States of America.
