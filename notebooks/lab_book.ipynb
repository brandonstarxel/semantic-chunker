       "'word based only on its context. Unlike left-to-\\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\\nof our paper are as follows:\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\\npre-training for language representations. Un-\\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\\nspeciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-\\ntuning based representation model that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\\nof sentence-level andtoken-level tasks, outper-\\nforming many task-speciﬁc architectures.\\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\\nNLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod-\\nels are available at https://github.com/\\ngoogle-research/bert .\\n2 Related Work\\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan-\\nguage representations, and we brieﬂy review the\\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\\n2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\\nLearning widely applicable representations of\\nwords has been an active area of research for\\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\\n2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings\\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\\nfering signiﬁcant improvements over embeddings\\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-\\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).These approaches have been generalized to\\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\\n2014). To train sentence representations, prior\\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\\ntence words given a representation of the previous\\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\\nwith existing task-speciﬁc architectures, ELMo\\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\\ncontextual representations through a task to pre-\\ndict a single word from both left and right context\\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod-\\nels.\\n2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the ﬁrst\\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em-\\nbedding parameters from unlabeled text (Col-\\nlobert and Weston, 2008).'"

Apart from output layers, the same architec-\\ntures are used in both pre-training and ﬁne-tuning. The same pre-trained model parameters are used to initialize\\nmodels for different down-stream tasks. During ﬁne-tuning, all parameters are ﬁne-tuned. [CLS] is a special\\nsymbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating ques-\\ntions/answers).\\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used\\nfor pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,\\n2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\\n2.3 Transfer Learning from Supervised Data\\nThere has also been work showing effective trans-\\nfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such\\nas natural language inference (Conneau et al.,\\n2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,\\n2017). Computer vision research has also demon-\\nstrated the importance of transfer learning from\\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\\nis to ﬁne-tune models pre-trained with Ima-\\ngeNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\\n3 BERT\\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa-\\ntion in this section. There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning . Dur-\\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\\nas a running example for this section.\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\\nthetensor2tensor library.1Because the use\\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\\nBERT BASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\\neters=110M) and BERT LARGE (L=24, H=1024,\\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\\nBERT BASE was chosen to have the same model\\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\\n1https://github.com/tensorﬂow/tensor2tensor\\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/ﬁlter size to be 4H,\\ni.e., 3072 for the H= 768 and 4096 for the H= 1024 .\\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans-',\n",

Fine-tuning is typically very fast, so it is rea-\\nsonable to simply run an exhaustive search over\\nthe above parameters and choose the model that\\nperforms best on the development set.\\nA.4 Comparison of BERT, ELMo ,and\\nOpenAI GPT\\nHere we studies the differences in recent popular\\nrepresentation learning models including ELMo,\\nOpenAI GPT and BERT. The comparisons be-\\ntween the model architectures are shown visually\\nin Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architec-\\nture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are ﬁne-\\ntuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based\\napproach.\\nThe most comparable existing pre-training\\nmethod to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a\\nleft-to-right Transformer LM on a large text cor-\\npus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT\\nwere intentionally made to make it as close to\\nGPT as possible so that the two methods could be\\nminimally compared. The core argument of this\\nwork is that the bi-directionality and the two pre-\\ntraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for\\nthe majority of the empirical improvements, but\\nwe do note that there are several other differences\\nbetween how BERT and GPT were trained:\\n• GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M\\nwords); BERT is trained on the BooksCor-\\npus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M\\nwords).\\n• GPT uses a sentence separator ( [SEP] ) and\\nclassiﬁer token ( [CLS] ) which are only in-\\ntroduced at ﬁne-tuning time; BERT learns\\n[SEP] ,[CLS] and sentence A/Bembed-\\ndings during pre-training.\\n• GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch\\nsize of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for\\n1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\\n• GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for\\nall ﬁne-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a\\ntask-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning learning rate which\\nperforms the best on the development set.To isolate the effect of these differences, we per-\\nform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which\\ndemonstrate that the majority of the improvements\\nare in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks\\nand the bidirectionality they enable.\\nA.5 Illustrations of Fine-tuning on Different\\nTasks\\nThe illustration of ﬁne-tuning BERT on different\\ntasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-speciﬁc\\nmodels are formed by incorporating BERT with\\none additional output layer, so a minimal num-\\nber of parameters need to be learned from scratch.\\nAmong the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level\\ntasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks.

       "   'BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for\\nLanguage Understanding\\nJacob Devlin Ming-Wei Chang Kenton Lee Kristina Toutanova\\nGoogle AI Language\\n{jacobdevlin,mingweichang,kentonl,kristout }@google.com\\nAbstract\\nWe introduce a new language representa-\\ntion model called BERT , which stands for\\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from\\nTransformers. Unlike recent language repre-\\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\\ntuned with just one additional output layer\\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on eleven natural language processing\\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\\n1 Introduction\\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\\nbe effective for improving many natural language\\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).There are two existing strategies for apply-\\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\\nstream tasks: feature-based andﬁne-tuning . The\\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\\net al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that\\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\\ntional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as\\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\\ntask-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the\\ndownstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning allpre-\\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\\ngeneral language representations.\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\\ncially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches. The ma-\\njor limitation is that standard language models are\\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\\nand could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-\\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\\nporate context from both directions.\\nIn this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based\\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\\nEncoder Representations from Transformers.\\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The\\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\\npredict the original vocabulary id of the maskedarXiv:1810.04805v2  [cs.CL]  24 May 2019',\n",

The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmenta-\\ntion embeddings and the position embeddings.\\nThe NSP task is closely related to representation-\\nlearning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and\\nLogeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior\\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa-\\nrameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure\\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti-\\ncal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\\nshufﬂed sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\\nextract long contiguous sequences.\\n3.2 Fine-tuning BERT\\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks—\\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs—by\\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\\nspeciﬁc inputs and outputs into BERT and ﬁne-\\ntune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in-\\nput, sentence Aand sentence Bfrom pre-training\\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and(4) a degenerate text- ∅pair in text classiﬁcation\\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep-\\nresentations are fed into an output layer for token-\\nlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\\ninto an output layer for classiﬁcation, such as en-\\ntailment or sentiment analysis.\\nCompared to pre-training, ﬁne-tuning is rela-\\ntively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa-\\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model.7We de-\\nscribe the task-speciﬁc details in the correspond-\\ning subsections of Section 4. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.5.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn this section, we present BERT ﬁne-tuning re-\\nsults on 11 NLP tasks.\\n4.1 GLUE\\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col-\\nlection of diverse natural language understanding\\ntasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are\\nincluded in Appendix B.1.\\nTo ﬁne-tune on GLUE, we represent the input\\nsequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)\\nas described in Section 3, and use the ﬁnal hid-\\nden vectorC∈RHcorresponding to the ﬁrst\\ninput token ( [CLS] ) as the aggregate representa-\\ntion. The only new parameters introduced during\\nﬁne-tuning are classiﬁcation layer weights W∈\\nRK×H, whereKis the number of labels. We com-\\npute a standard classiﬁcation loss with CandW,\\ni.e.,log(softmax( CWT)).\\n7For example, the BERT SQuAD model can be trained in\\naround 30 minutes on a single Cloud TPU to achieve a Dev\\nF1 score of 91.0%.\\n8See (10) in https://gluebenchmark.com/faq .',\n",
       "   'Input/Output Representations To make BERT\\nhandle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input\\nrepresentation is able to unambiguously represent\\nboth a single sentence and a pair of sentences\\n(e.g.,⟨Question, Answer⟩) in one token sequence.\\nThroughout this work, a “sentence” can be an arbi-\\ntrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual\\nlinguistic sentence. A “sequence” refers to the in-\\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst\\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\\nsiﬁcation token ( [CLS] ). The ﬁnal hidden state\\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\\ngregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation\\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\\ntoken ( [SEP] ). Second, we add a learned embed-\\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\\nto sentence Aor sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\\nwe denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden\\nvector of the special [CLS] token asC∈RH,\\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ithinput token\\nasTi∈RH.\\nFor a given token, its input representation is\\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason-\\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\\nright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\\nstandard conditional language models can only be\\ntrained left-to-right orright-to-left, since bidirec-\\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\\ndirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\nformer is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while\\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer\\ndecoder” since it can be used for text generation.In order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked\\nLM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\\ncase, the ﬁnal hidden vectors corresponding to the\\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\\nstructing the entire input.\\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\\nﬁne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\\npear during ﬁne-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\\nnot always replace “masked” words with the ac-\\ntual[MASK] token. The training data generator\\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\\nthei-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\\nTiwill be used to predict the original token with\\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\\nTask #2: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques-\\ntion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer-\\nence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela-\\ntionship between two sentences, which is not di-']],\n",

The same pre-trained model parameters are used to initialize\\nmodels for different down-stream tasks. During ﬁne-tuning, all parameters are ﬁne-tuned. [CLS] is a special\\nsymbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating ques-\\ntions/answers).\\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used\\nfor pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,\\n2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\\n2.3 Transfer Learning from Supervised Data\\nThere has also been work showing effective trans-\\nfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such\\nas natural language inference (Conneau et al.,\\n2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,\\n2017). Computer vision research has also demon-\\nstrated the importance of transfer learning from\\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\\nis to ﬁne-tune models pre-trained with Ima-\\ngeNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\\n3 BERT\\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa-\\ntion in this section. There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning . Dur-\\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\\nas a running example for this section.\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\\nthetensor2tensor library.1Because the use\\nof Transformers has become',\n",
       " ' BERT, which may be a sin-\\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst\\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\\nsiﬁcation token ( [CLS] ). The ﬁnal hidden state\\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\\ngregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation\\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\\ntoken ( [SEP] ). Second, we add a learned embed-\\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\\nto sentence Aor sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\\nwe denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden\\nvector of the special [CLS] token asC2RH,\\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ithinput token\\nasTi2RH.\\nFor a given token, its input representation is\\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason-\\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\\nright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\\nstandard conditional language models can only be\\ntrained left-to-right orright-to-left, since bidirec-\\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\\ndirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\nformer is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while\\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer\\ndecoder” since it can be used for text generation.In order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\\n',\n",
       " ', as well as token-level tasks such as\\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).There are two existing strategies for apply-\\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\\nstream tasks: feature-based andﬁne-tuning . The\\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\\net al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that\\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\\ntional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as\\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\\ntask-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the\\ndownstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning allpre-\\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\\ngeneral language representations.\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\\ncially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches. The ma-\\njor limitation is that standard language models are\\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\\nand could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-\\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\\nporate context from both directions.\\nIn this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based\\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\\nEncoder Representations from Transformers.\\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The\\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\\npredict the original vocabulary id of the maskedarXiv',\n",
       " ' a\\nleft-to-right Transformer LM on a large text cor-\\npus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT\\nwere intentionally made to make it as close to\\nGPT as possible so that the two methods could be\\nminimally compared. The core argument of this\\nwork is that the bi-directionality and the two pre-\\ntraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for\\nthe majority of the empirical improvements, but\\nwe do note that there are several other differences\\nbetween how BERT and GPT were trained:\\n• GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M\\nwords); BERT is trained on the BooksCor-\\npus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M\\nwords).\\n• GPT uses a sentence separator ( [SEP] ) and\\nclassiﬁer token ( [CLS] ) which are only in-\\ntroduced at ﬁne-tuning time; BERT learns\\n[SEP] ,[CLS] and sentence A/Bembed-\\ndings during pre-training.\\n• GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch\\nsize of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for\\n1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\\n• GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for\\nall ﬁne-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a\\ntask-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning learning rate which\\nperforms the best on the development set.To isolate the effect of these differences, we per-\\nform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which\\ndemonstrate that the majority of the improvements\\nare in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks\\nand the bidirectionality they enable.\\nA.5 Illustrations of Fine-tuning on Different\\nTasks\\nThe illustration of ﬁne-tuning BERT on different\\ntasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-speciﬁc\\nmodels are formed by incorporating BERT with\\none additional output layer, so a minimal num-\\nber of parameters need to be learned from scratch.\\nAmong the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level\\ntasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks.

Unlike left-to-\\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\\nof our paper are as follows:\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\\npre-training for language representations. Un-\\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\\nspeciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-\\ntuning based representation model that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\\nof sentence-level andtoken-level tasks, outper-\\nforming many task-speciﬁc architectures.\\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\\nNLP tasks.

      "Context:  and COPA, human performance is perfect. On three other tasks, it is\n",
      "in the mid-to-high 90s. On the diagnostics, all models continue to lag signiﬁcantly behind humans.\n",
      "Though all models obtain near perfect gender parity scores on Winogender, this is due to the fact that\n",

      "6 Conclusion\n",
      "We present SuperGLUE, a new benchmark for evaluating general-purpose language understanding\n",
      "systems. SuperGLUE updates the GLUE benchmark by identifying a new set of challenging NLU\n",
      "tasks, as measured by the difference between human and machine baselines. The set of eight tasks in\n",
      "our benchmark emphasizes diverse task formats and low-data training data tasks, with nearly half the\n",
      "tasks having fewer than 1k examples and all but one of the tasks having fewer than 10k examples.\n",
      "We evaluate BERT-based baselines and ﬁnd that they still lag behind humans by nearly 20 points.\n",
      "Given the difﬁculty of SuperGLUE for BERT, we expect that further progress in multi-task, transfer,\n",
      "and unsupervised/self-supervised learning techniques will be necessary to approach human-level per-\n",
