# Semantic Chunking Project

Welcome to the **Semantic Chunking Project**, a comprehensive research initiative focused on developing and evaluating innovative methods for semantic chunking. Our goal is to enhance understanding and processing of natural language through advanced chunking techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components, each designed to facilitate efficient research and development:

### Notebooks

- **Location**: `notebooks/lab_book.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: This Jupyter notebook contains detailed records of experiments, including data analysis, algorithm testing, and results evaluation.

### Codebase

- **Package**: `chroma_research`
- **Example Usage**: Refer to `main.py` for example implementations using our package, demonstrating how to apply our methods to your datasets.

### Data

- **Location**: `/data`
- **Details**: All databases and datasets utilized in our research are stored here, ensuring easy access and reproducibility.

### Documentation

- **Notes**: `notes.md`
- **Contents**: Contains references, bibliographic details, and inspiration sources that have guided our research methodology.

## Technical Specifications

- **Python Version**: 3.11.8

Please ensure that your development environment matches the specified Python version to avoid compatibility issues.
